#How Java Works :

	Platform Independent [Machine Independent -- Windows, Mac, Linux]
	Java program runs -- JVM(Java Virtual Machine)
	Java Development/ Write code -- JDK(Java Developmenet Kit).
	JDK within JRE(Java Runtime Envirunment),
	JRE within JVM
	JVM --- byte code(.class file) ---> machine code
