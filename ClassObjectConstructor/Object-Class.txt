	=====Object=====

	#An entity that has state and behavior
	#It can be physical and logical
	#Object is a real world entity.
	#Object is an instance of a class.
	#An object has three characteristics :
		# state
		# behavior
		# identity - unique ID [ used internally by the JVM to identify each object uniquely. ]

		Example : Pen is an object. Its name is Reynolds, color is white etc. known as its state. 
			 It is used to write, so writing is its behavior.
	#Three way initialize object :
		#By reference variable
		#By method
		#By constructor



	======Class=====

	#A Class is a group of object which have common properties.
	#It is a template or blueprint from which objects are created.
	#It is a logical entity
	#Class in java can contain :
		#fields
		#methods
		#constructors
		#blocks
		#nested class and interface


	#Instance variable doesn't get memory at compile time. It gets memory at run time when object(instance) is created.
	#new keyword is used to allocate memory at run time. All objects get memory in Heap memory area.
