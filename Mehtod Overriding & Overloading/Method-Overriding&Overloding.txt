	===------Method Overloading===

	# Method overloading is a process that allows a class to have two or more methods habing same naem,
 	   as long a s their parameter declarations are different.	
	# Methods are called overloaded method.

	# Same method names
	# Parameter lists are different
	# Inside the same class
	




	===------Method Overriding-----===

	# Declaring a method in subclass which is already present in superclass is known as method overriding.

	# Code reuse
	# One interface, multiple implement
	# Run time ploymorphism

	# Name, signature type, parameter must be same.
	# if a method can't be inherited, then it can't be overridden.
	# A method declared as final or static can't be overridden.
	# Constructor can't be overridden.
