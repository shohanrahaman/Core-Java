	# Inheritaance :

		When one object acquires all the properties (methods and fields) and behaviours of parent object  known as inheritance. 
		
		# For code reusability. 
		# For method overriding
		# To implement parent-child relationship
		---------------------------------------------------------------------------
		# use extends keyword
		# Parent class/ Super class/ Base class
 		# Child class/ sub class/ derived class

	# Polymorphism :

		When one task is performed by different ways known as polymorphism. Ex : to convince the customer differently.
		In java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.		

		# Types of polymorphism :
			# Compile time / static polymorphism (Method overloading/Constructor overloading)
			# Run time / dynamic polymorphishm (Method overriding)
	# Abstraction :

		Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as abstraction. Ex : phone call, we don't know the internal processing.

		# Two way to achieve abstraction in java :
			# Abstract class ( 0 to 100% )
			# Interface ( Achieve 100% abstraction )

		# Abstract method :
			# Abstract mehtod has no body
			# it must be in the abstract class
			# it must be oberridden
			# it can never be final and static

		# Abstract Class :
			# Abstract class have abstract and non abstract method
			# Abstract class can't be instantiated(object)
		
		# Interface :
			# An interface is a collection of abstract methods
			# Fully abstraction
			# support multiple inheritance 
			# Variables are constant (public, static and final)
			

	# Encapsulation :

		Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit is known as encapsulation. Ex : capsule, it is wrapped with different medicines.
			# Packaging variable and method into a single unit.
			# Protecting data by declaring them as private.
			# Private data will be hidden from other classes and they can only be accessed through the methods of theri current class. this is known as  data hiding.

			Benefits :

				# provies data hiding
				# reusability
				# code can be modified without breaking the code
